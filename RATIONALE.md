# Why is compliance checking so hard and what should we do about it?

## Background

The climate science modelling community generates 10s of 1000s of simulations per year 
across the world. There is a general need to share these simulations, usually formatted 
as [NetCDF files](http://***), with the international research community.

Internationally high-priority projects, such as the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison 
Project ([CMIP6](http://***)), have involved extensive efforts within the scientific 
community to agree on [metadata standards](***) to improve the discoverability, accessibility 
and usability of the data.

However, in spite of these concerted efforts the data sets generated by the community 
are still heterogeneous and significant work is required at the user end in order to 
read and analysis the outputs.

So, why is compliance checking so hard? And why hasn't this problem been solved yet?
