Installation
============

Source
------

It is recommended to create a fresh Python virtual environment for installing
``checksit``, which can be installed directly from GitHub:

.. code-block::

   pip install git+https://github.com/cedadev/checksit.git

or by cloning the repository and installing that:

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/cedadev/checksit.git
   cd checksit
   pip install .

----

Other installation methods might be added later.
