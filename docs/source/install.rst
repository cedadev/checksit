Installation
============

Source
------

Download the latest and development versions directly from GitHub into your home directory,
and change directory into the repository

.. code-block::

   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/cedadev/checksit.git
   cd checksit

It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment, and install ``checksit`` into that

.. code-block::

   # create virtual environment called venv
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # install checksit and requirements
   pip install .

Other installation methods might be added later.
